# Rally Study 01 (RS01)

_status: in development_

An exploratory study on what sites people use and how long they use them.

## Requirements
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Mozilla web-ext](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/getting-started-with-web-ext/)

This repository contains the code needed to build the Rally Study 01 Web Extension. 
The study submits data through [Mozilla Rally's Web Extension](https://github.com/mozilla-rally/rally-core-addon),
or can be run locally without Mozilla Rally installed on your computer.

## Quickstart

```bash
# install all dependencies
npm install

# run developer mode.
# this will run web-ext and listen for all input files, 
# and will rebuild and auto-reload for you.
npm run watch

# build the addon and output the xpi so that it can be side-loaded in Firefox Nightly.
# See the "running thiis study to collect your own data" 
# section below for further instructions.
npm run build:addon

# --- Other commands you might be interested in ---
# generate documentation for all modules in the doc/ directory.
npm run doc

# run unit tests
npm run test:unit
```

## Understanding this repository

This repository contains everything need to generate documentation and build the study web extension itself.

As of this writing, this repository uses a vendored version of `web-science`, contained in `/WebScience`. We will remove this vendored version once
[we have published `0.1.0` of the library](https://github.com/mozilla-rally/web-science/issues/3).

Below is a curated description of the important modules:

- `src/main.js` - the main entrypoint for the study. Configures the Rally API, establishes the callback for page data, etc.
- `src/attention-reporter.js` - the reporting module for the data collection. Registers the `src/attention-collector.js` content script and handles the starting and stopping of measurement.
- `src/event-stream-inspector.js` & `serc/event-stream-storage.js` – these modules are used in developer mode only. They enable the developer to examine which events are being collected and to export the collected data as a JSON file.
- `src/app/` – the code for the frontend component of the options page that is made available in developer mode.

## the event data collected by this study

This study records two types of events:
1. *attention events* (`RS01.attentionEvent`), defined by `web-science` as an active tab in an active window
2. *audio events* (`RS01.audioEvent`), defined by `web-science` as an audio event playing on an active tab in an active window

The events collected in this study are defined by the measurements schema, kept in `schema/`. All of the building & watching NPM commands in this repository will first generate this schema. To do it yourself and see all the fields collected by this study, run `npm run build:schema` and observe the results in `schema/measurements.1.schema.json`.

If you want to add a new property to the `attentionEvent` or `audioEvent` events, You'll have to update in two places:
1. add the field into `src/attention-collector.js` in the appropriate location
2. add the field in the `attentionEventProperties` or `audioEventProperties` objects in `schemas/measurements.config.mjs`. If you want to add a new *shared* property, update `attentionEventProperties`.
3. if you are running `npm run watch` already, you will have to run `npm run build:schema` and your dev browser will update.
4. if you want to build the study, just run `npm run build` as you normally would and the changes will be applied.

## running this study locally to collect your own data and play with it

1. fork or clone this repository
2. run `npm install`
3. if you are:
   1. a chrome user: run `npm run build`, then [follow the instructions to load an unpacked web extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/getstarted/). That's it!
   2. a firefox user: 
      1. you'll have to use Nightly & set `xpinstall.signatures.required` to `false` in `about:config`. 
      2. then run `npm run build:addon` in this directory.
      3. Then you can load the add-on from `about:addons`.
4. browse for a few days to generate data.
5. Go the the extension page and click the `download JSON` button on the top right.
